# Analyzing Data for Deaths and Vaccination Related to COVID
The SQL project focused on analyzing COVID-19 data from the PortfolioProject database, specifically targeting information regarding cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations across various locations and dates. The project began with basic data retrieval queries, sorting the data by different criteria such as location, date, total cases, and new cases. Subsequent queries delved deeper into the analysis, calculating death percentages, infection rates, and identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts. The exploration extended to continents, highlighting those with the highest death counts. Moreover, global trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths were examined over time. A significant aspect of the project involved assessing the correlation between population and vaccination, utilizing both standard queries and common table expressions (CTEs) for enhanced readability and efficiency. Overall, the project provided valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 on various regions, populations, and vaccination efforts, aiding in understanding and managing the pandemic's effects.
